How do I approach designing software?


I approach designing software now in a creative and concise way. I think about what scene I am trying to create, the shapes needed to complete it, and lighting that helps bring the scene to life or "3D". 
What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
Learning how to implement textures was a very big skill that I learned that helped with my scene. 


What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Being able to prepare for the program, I will definitely apply to future work. Such as writing out the required scene, researching what is needed in the code to be able to produce the scene, and testing out the image piece by piece until the full image is produced. 


How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs just as I approached designing this project. Preparation, development, testing. 


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Test the code as you go instead of wait until the entire code is finished. 


How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As I learned new concepts about graphics such as changing the camera's focus, implementing the keyboard for a user to move around the scene, this has helped me perfect my vision as I completed other aspects of the scene such as lighting. Being able to move around the scene helped me determine if I needed point lights or more specular/ambular lighting. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science helps me challenge myself. Academically and personally. Sometimes, computer science can be a bit intimidating and needs time to learn and perfect the specific skills at that moment. Computer Science will also help me on my journey to entering the robotics field. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations broadened my horizons for my professional career in the future. Now, I have an interest in animations that I didn't realize was in my reach. Now, with the skills, I'll also depict movies that involves animation, such as Disney Movies.  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
